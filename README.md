# Contacts Project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

This project is a simple React application to add, view and remove contacts. The point of this project is to understand the React fundamentals and implement its concepts.

To run this project, you will have to setup and run the backend server for the Contacts app. This server is primarily an API that will interact with the server for storage and retrieval of data.

## Backend Server setup

Getting the server running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server2.git`
2. `cd reactnd-contacts-server2`
3. install its dependencies - `npm install`
4. start the server - `node server.js`

## Contacts App Setup

* clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/harishb93/reactnd-contacts-app.git`
* install the dependencies - `npm install`

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
